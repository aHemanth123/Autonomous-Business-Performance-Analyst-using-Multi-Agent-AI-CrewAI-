# Autonomous  Performance Analyst

An **agentic AI system** that autonomously analyzes business performance data, detects trends and anomalies, generates executive-level insights, and produces a **real PDF business report** using a coordinated **multi-agent architecture** built with **CrewAI**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Multi-Agent AI** can be applied to real-world business analytics problems.

Instead of a single LLM prompt, the system uses **specialized agents**, each responsible for a specific analytical task, collaborating through **explicit task context chaining** to deliver decision-ready insights.

---

## 🧠 Why Multi-Agent AI?

- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- Improved reasoning quality  
- Deterministic task execution  
- Scalable and maintainable architecture  

Each agent operates independently but collaborates via explicit task dependencies.
